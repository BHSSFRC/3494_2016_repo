Alright new programmer from now on your job is very simple: you are going to punch sharks.

*In the face.*

All jokes aside, this is the software you need to start programming as of 10/10/2016.

* [Eclipse **MARS**](https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Mars/2)
 * Remember if you get the 64-bit version or the 32 bit version.
* [The FRC update suite](http://www.ni.com/download/first-robotics-software-2016/5773/en) - this is the 2016 version, and you need the serial number off of the package that we got in the kit of parts.
* [The Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
 * Make sure you have the 32 bit version if you got 32 bit Eclipse or 64 or 64 bit.
* The FRC Eclipse plugins
 * The instructions are here [in image format.](http://imgur.com/LghDdZ0)
* [MinGW](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mingw/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe?r=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fmingw%2Ffiles%2FInstaller%2F&ts=1473376643&use_mirror=superb-sea2) (or another C++ compiler for your OS of choice.)
 * No, we aren't switching from C++.
 * If you need help with setting up MinGW, ***ASK***.
* [NavX C++ libraries](http://www.pdocs.kauailabs.com/navx-mxp/software/roborio-libraries/c/), because who knows maybe we *will* use the gyroscope this year.
* Last but not least, your best friend, [Github.](https://www.github.com)
 * Get an account, and, if you can, [the github client.](https://desktop.github.com/) (You don't need to use GitHub's client, but it works really well.)
  * **YOU MUST RUN THE INSTALLER AS AN ADMINISTRATOR.** If you don't have an admin account on your computer...get one.
 * If you can't get the desktop client for some reason, [the command line version is fine.](https://git-scm.com/)
 * And if you have no idea how to use git, [this site should help you get started.](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
