# Welcome!

If you are a programmer who is part of the team, work as follows:

1. Get something to do.
 * Yes, there is something to do. Now go figure out what it is.
2. Create your own branch to work off of.
 * Source it off of `develop` (recommended) or your branch of choice (here be dragons). DO NOT SOURCE IT OFF OF `master` UNDER PENALTY OF ~~LAW~~ SEVERE IRRITATION BY LEAD PROGRAMMER.
 * Name this branch after what you're doing on it. Ex. `fancy-autonomous`.
 * *Really hot* hotfixes may be committed directly to `develop` as long as everyone knows it's happening.
3. Work on the job you got in step one. Push all your commits to the branch you made in step two.
 * Feel free to merge other people's branches in to your own.
4. When you finish what you were assigned to do, merge your branch into `develop` using a pull request.
 * At least try to describe what you did.
 * ***DO NOT MERGE INTO MASTER. EVER. YES, THIS IS A THREAT.***
5. repeat until the end of the season.

## Outside contribution

Not part of the team? You can still help if you want! Make a fork of the `develop` branch, work on your fork however you please, then just make a pull request (PR). Your PR should be reasonably descriptive so that we don't need to read the whole diff to know what you did. Team 3494 reserves the right to reject an outside pull request for any reason.

## When will we merge into master?

Merges into master will be made when the code on `develop` is in a reasonably high-quality state, i.e. both the programmers and drivers are happy with it. Said merges will be accompanied by a tag (read: release).
